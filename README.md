# ðŸ“±Weather App UI
## Description
"I have developed a weather application using Flutter, designed as a single-screen interface to provide users with current weather conditions and additional information. This app seamlessly integrates with the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/), allowing for real-time retrieval of accurate weather data. I employed Flutter Bloc for efficient state management."
